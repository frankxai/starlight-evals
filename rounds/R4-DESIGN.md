**Design date:** 2026-08-28 · **Status at time of writing:** specified, unrun
**Harness:** `harness/deep-reasoning.mjs` · **Tasks:** `fixtures/deep-reasoning/`
**Doctrine:** `ROUTING-DOCTRINE.md` (A1 autonomy boundary, A2 sample floor, A3 ledger)

---

## 1. Why this round exists

`routing-table.json` routes the `deep-reasoning` class to Opus with
`confidence: "low"`, `rounds: 0`, and this evidence field:

> Doctrine, NOT yet measured — no arena card has a deep-reasoning lane where Opus
> ceiling would show. R4 must build it before this hardens.

R3 named the same gap as its own weakness: its card "measures COMPLIANCE, not
CAPABILITY CEILING." Every other class in the routing table has at least one
receipt. This one has a hunch.

The hunch is now more expensive to get wrong. On the current price list, Fable 5
is **$10 / $50 per MTok** against Opus 5 at **$5 / $25** — 2x per token in both
directions. Routing deep reasoning to the wrong tier is a 2x error either way,
and on a subscription it burns weekly allowance at 2x. "Reserve the expensive
tiers for where they win" is only a cost lever if you have measured where they
win.

## 2. Hypothesis

> **H1.** On multi-step reasoning tasks where a single wrong intermediate step
> propagates to a wrong final answer, the more expensive tier produces materially
> fewer wrong-answer runs than the cheaper tier, by a margin large enough to
> justify its price multiple.

H1 is falsifiable in three distinct directions, and §8 states in advance what
each direction would mean for the routing table. The null — that the tiers are
indistinguishable on this card — is the outcome R3 already produced on an easier
card, and §4 treats it as a design failure rather than a finding.

**H1 is a claim about cost per *correct* answer, not about capability.** A tier
that passes one more task while costing four times as much has not supported H1.

## 3. Contestants

| Key | Model ID | Input $/MTok | Output $/MTok | Context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fable` | `claude-fable-5` | 10.00 | 50.00 | 1M |
| `opus` | `claude-opus-5` | 5.00 | 25.00 | 1M |
| `sonnet` | `claude-sonnet-5` | 2.00 | 10.00 | 1M |
| `haiku` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | 1.00 | 5.00 | 200K |

Exact model IDs, never date-suffixed. Note that R1–R3 ran `claude-opus-4-8`;
R4 contests `claude-opus-5`, so R4 is **not** a continuation of the R1–R3 Opus
series and must not be pooled with it.

## 4. The critical design constraint: this card must not saturate

R3's finding was capability **saturation**. All four tiers passed the coding task
and the grounding task, and the routing table records why that is worth almost
nothing: *"PASS by all 4 on ONE trivial task (palindrome) — saturation on an easy
distribution."* A card that everything passes ranks nothing.

R4's entire job is a task distribution hard enough to separate the tiers.
Designing against ceiling effects is the primary constraint, above elegance and
above coverage.

**Pre-registered expected spread.** Per-task predictions live in each fixture's
`prediction` field. Summed across the six tasks:

| Tier | Predicted pass count (of 6) |
|---|---|
| `fable` | 6 |
| `opus` | 6 |
| `sonnet` | 3 |
| `haiku` | 0 |

The card is built to include tasks Haiku is expected to fail. A predicted Haiku
score of 0/6 is deliberate: if Haiku scores well here, either the card is too
easy or the routing table's cheap-tier bias is better founded than anyone
thought — both are informative, and both are recorded rather than explained away.

**Void rule (binding).** If the spread between the best and worst tier is **0
tasks** — every tier scores identically, whether 6/6 or 0/6 — the round is
**VOID**. A void round yields no routing evidence, does not count toward the A2
two-round floor, and does not change `routing-table.json`. The harness computes
this itself and stamps `verdict: "VOID"`; it is not a judgment call made after
seeing the numbers. A void round means the card was wrong and must be redesigned
before R5.

A spread of 1 task is weak separation and should be reported as such rather than
narrated into a finding.

## 5. Task families

Six tasks, one fixture file each, spanning the five families that actually
separate reasoning tiers.

| ID | Family | Separation mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `d1-deduction-trap-ledger` | multi-step deduction with a trap intermediate step | Nine ordered rules over two quantities. Treating 1 as prime raises the running balance from 672 to 682, which crosses a threshold of 680 and **flips a conditional branch** — the wrong intermediate step changes the arithmetic path, not just the total. A second trap punishes applying R7 before R6. |
| `d2-attractor-random-reveal` | plausible-but-wrong attractor | The random-reveal variant of the three-door problem. Surface-identical to the classic puzzle whose memorized answer is 2/3; because the auditor is uninformed and selects uniformly, the correct posterior is **1/2**. Recall produces the wrong answer; only conditioning produces the right one. |
| `d3-longctx-reconcile` | long-context synthesis across distant facts | Two needles at sections 17 and 288 of a 300-section handbook, neither usable alone, among ~298 same-shaped schedule facts. A **live decoy** at section 12 (a retired compaction job, never explicitly ruled out) yields a fully self-consistent wrong answer. |
| `d4-multifile-idempotency-bug` | subtle multi-file bug | Four files, none wrong in isolation. A retry wrapper re-invokes a callable that mints a fresh idempotency key per attempt, so the gateway's dedupe never engages. Option F is a near-miss whose premise is **true** and whose fix is wrong. |
| `d5-architecture-slo-tradeoff` | architecture trade-off | Three constraints (latency, cost, durability); exactly one option satisfies all three. The attractor is both the fastest and the cheapest option, and fails only the constraint a model skips if it optimises the two salient numbers. |
| `d6-constraint-backtrack-assignment` | constraint satisfaction requiring backtracking | 5x3 grid, ten constraints, no constraint pinning a cell directly; one constraint compares two lanes by alphabetical rank, forcing a partial assignment to be revisited. Uniqueness **verified by exhaustive search** over all 14,400 grids, not asserted. |

Each fixture carries its own prompt, answer format, ground truth **with the full
derivation**, accepting regexes, pre-registered attractors, and per-tier
prediction. A third party can read a fixture and check the ground truth without
running anything.

### Context-window fairness

`claude-haiku-4-5` has a 200K context window against 1M for the other three. The
long-context task is assembled at roughly 18.5K tokens, well inside Haiku's
window, so a Haiku failure on `d3` is a reasoning failure and not an inability to
be asked the question. **Do not grow `d3` past ~150K tokens** without either
dropping Haiku from that task or recording it as N/A — a task the cheap tier
cannot physically receive is not a measurement of the cheap tier.

## 6. Scoring

**Mechanical, binary, no partial credit.**

- Every task instructs the model to end its reply with a single `ANSWER:` line in
  a stated form. The harness takes the **last** such line, normalises it
  (strip markdown decoration and a trailing period; then the per-task steps —
  collapse whitespace, uppercase, strip commas, strip currency), and tests it
  against the fixture's `accept` regexes.
- **PASS** = a match. **FAIL** = no match. **FAIL-ATTRACTOR** = no match against
  `accept` but a match against a pre-registered attractor, recorded with the
  attractor's label so a near-miss is distinguishable from noise.
  **NO-ANSWER** = no `ANSWER:` line was emitted. **ERROR** = the call failed.
- **Ties:** a task on which every contestant passes is recorded as
  `tie (n-way) — saturated` and contributes nothing to separation. Ties are not
  broken by style, speed, or cost; per-tier cost is reported separately and never
  used to convert a tie into a win.
- **Partial credit: none.** A task is passed or it is not. `d6` in particular is
  all-or-nothing across ten cells, which is the point — a single propagated error
  fails the task, and propagation is the property under measurement.

### No LLM judge on this card

R1 used a blind non-contestant judge (`sonnet`) because only two tiers were
contesting. **R4 contests all four Claude tiers, so no Claude model is a
non-contestant** and the R1 arrangement cannot be reproduced honestly. Rather
than use a contestant to judge its own rivals, R4 is fully mechanical: the
architecture task was converted from a rubric-scored task into one with a
determinate answer (§5, `d5`).

The rubric-judged variant is **deferred to R5**, gated on the cross-family judge
already on the doctrine roadmap (`ROUTING-DOCTRINE.md`, roadmap item 2: GPT-5 via
OpenRouter as a bias-free judge). Until that exists, R4 measures what can be
measured without a judge, and says so.

## 7. Effort as a controlled variable

Effort (`output_config.effort`) changes both quality and spend inside a single
model. A cheap tier at `xhigh` may beat an expensive tier at `low`, which would
change the routing conclusion entirely, so the choice must be explicit.

**Decision: hold effort constant at `high` for R4. Do not sweep.**

Justification:

1. `high` is the API default (equivalent to omitting the parameter), so it is the
   setting the routing rule will actually apply to in production. A round run at
   a non-default effort would measure a configuration nobody runs.
2. A sweep multiplies the cell count by the number of levels. With n=1 per cell
   already the dominant weakness, spending the budget on a second **round** (the
   A2 floor) buys more than spending it on a second effort level within one round.
3. **The sweep cannot be run symmetrically anyway.** `claude-haiku-4-5` does not
   accept `output_config.effort` — the API rejects it. A "sweep across all four
   contestants" is not available; only a three-tier sweep is, and a three-tier
   sweep answers a different question than the four-tier comparison.

**Stated asymmetry, not hidden.** The harness sends no effort flag for
`claude-haiku-4-5` and records `effortApplied: null` on its rows. Haiku therefore
runs at the harness default while the other three run at an explicit `high`. This
is a real confound and it is recorded in the receipt's `caveats`. It cannot be
removed without either dropping Haiku or sending a parameter the API rejects.

**What this round therefore does NOT establish:** the cost-adjusted effort
frontier. "Is Sonnet at `xhigh` cheaper per correct answer than Opus at `high`?"
is a live and valuable question that R4 does not answer. It is the natural R6.

## 8. Cost accounting

Per run, the harness records `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `costUSD`,
`durationMs`, and wall-clock. Per tier it reports totals and
**`costPerPassedTaskUSD`** — total spend divided by tasks passed, `null` when the
tier passed nothing.

Cost is attributed from the CLI's own `modelUsage[<model id>]` entry for the
contestant, which excludes the background Haiku call the CLI makes on every
invocation. The default CLI system prompt is replaced with a minimal one, which
drops per-call harness overhead from roughly 27,300 tokens to roughly 250 —
without that, harness overhead would dominate the cost column and the
cost-adjusted finding would be an artifact of the transport.

`costPerPassedTaskUSD` is the number the routing decision turns on. Capability
alone cannot answer "is the expensive tier worth its multiple."

## 9. Falsification criteria (pre-registered)

Stated before the data exists. `S` = pass count out of 6.

| Result | Reading | Routing consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Spread = 0 | **VOID.** The card failed to separate. | No change. Redesign the card. Does not count toward the A2 floor. |
| `S(opus) >= S(fable)` **and** `S(opus) - max(S(sonnet), S(haiku)) >= 2` **and** `costPerPassedTask(opus) < costPerPassedTask(fable)` | H1 supported, Opus is the efficient tier | **Keep `route: "opus"`.** Confidence low -> medium. Still `autoApply: false`; the A2 floor needs a second round. |
| `S(fable) - S(opus) >= 2` **and** the extra passes are tasks Opus failed | Fable's 2x price buys capability Opus lacks | **Change to `route: "fable"`**, confidence medium, `autoApply: false`, pending R5. Record the specific tasks in the evidence field. |
| `max(S(sonnet), S(haiku)) >= S(opus)` | Saturation across tiers, same as R3's coding result | **Down-route** to the cheapest tier that matched, per the doctrine's core rule: "when a task-class is capability-saturated across tiers, route to the cheapest passing tier." Confidence medium at most. |
| `S(opus) - max(S(sonnet), S(haiku)) == 1` | Weak separation | Report as weak. **Do not change the route on one task of difference at n=1.** |
| Any tier with `errors > 0` | Incompletely measured | That tier's row is not usable for a routing change. |

**Ceiling on any outcome.** Under A2, one round sets `confidence` to at most
`medium` and leaves `autoApply: false`. **R4 cannot harden the deep-reasoning
rule no matter how clean the result is.** R4 is round 1 of at least 2.

## 10. How R5 replicates this

R4 is designed so R5 is a clean replication rather than a new experiment.

- **Same fixtures, unchanged.** Every task is deterministic: fixed prompts, and
  `d3` assembled by index arithmetic with no RNG and no clock, so the document is
  byte-identical between runs.
- **Same command:** `npm run eval:r4`.
- **Change exactly one thing at a time.** If R5 changes the contestant set, the
  effort level, or the transport, it is a different experiment and the two rounds
  are not concordant — they are two n=1 rounds of different things.
- **Concordance** means the same routing consequence fires in §9 in both rounds,
  not that the pass counts are numerically identical.
- Only after two concordant rounds may `deep-reasoning` move to
  `confidence: "high"`, and `autoApply` stays `false` regardless: the class is
  `stakes: "medium"`, and per A1 only the low-stakes classes auto-route.

## 11. Known weaknesses of this design

Named up front, because a design that hides its weaknesses is not a
pre-registration.

1. **n=1 per cell.** Six tasks, one run each per tier. A single lucky or unlucky
   sample moves a tier by one task. This is the dominant weakness and it is not
   fixed by R4; it is why the A2 floor exists.
2. **Model-in-harness.** Runs go through the `claude` CLI, not the raw API. The
   system prompt is replaced to keep cost attributable, but this still measures
   the model as the CLI runs it. R1–R3 carry the same caveat.
3. **The Haiku effort asymmetry** (§7) is a real confound that cannot be removed.
4. **Six tasks is a small distribution.** The families were chosen because they
   are known to separate reasoning tiers, which is a designed bias toward
   separation — the mirror image of R3's bias toward compliance. R4 does not
   measure the tiers on average work; it measures them where reasoning depth is
   the binding constraint. That is the right target for this routing class and
   the wrong target for any other.
5. **Attractor coverage is incomplete.** Pre-registered attractors capture the
   wrong answers that were anticipated. An unanticipated wrong answer scores
   FAIL, which is correct but less informative.
6. **`d2` may be contaminated by training exposure.** The random-reveal variant is
   discussed in the literature. If a tier has memorised the *variant* rather than
   the classic puzzle, `d2` measures recall, not reasoning — in the opposite
   direction from the one intended. Nothing in this design can distinguish those
   two cases.

## 12. Reproducing this round

```bash
npm run eval:r4 -- --dry-run     # assemble every prompt, spend nothing
npm run eval:r4                  # full card, 6 tasks x 4 tiers, effort=high
npm run eval:r4 -- --tasks d2,d6 --models opus,haiku    # subset
```

The harness writes a run-local receipt to `out/`. It never writes to `rounds/`;
promoting a run into a published receipt is a reviewed human step, per the repo
rule that a published receipt is never edited after the fact.

If the `claude` CLI is absent or unauthenticated, the harness emits an **UNRUN**
receipt with zero result rows and says so in a banner. That is the correct
output. An empty honest result is worth more than an invented number, because
the artifact this lane feeds — `routing-table.json` — is only worth anything if
every number in it is real.

## Postscript — added 2026-08-28, after the round ran

**Nothing above this line was changed after data existed.** This section records
the outcome and is not part of the pre-registration.

R4 ran on 2026-08-28. Receipt:
[`2026-08-28-r4-deep-reasoning.json`](2026-08-28-r4-deep-reasoning.json).
**Verdict: VOID-EQUIVALENT. The card saturated.**

- **Run 1:** every tier scored 6/6. Spread 0 — VOID by the §4 rule.
- **Run 2** (identical card, after a token-accounting fix in the harness):
  `opus` 6/6, `sonnet` 6/6, `fable` 5/6, `haiku` 5/6. Spread 1, but *both*
  non-PASS cells are non-reasoning — one transport error, one reply that omitted
  the required `ANSWER:` line. Every tier answered correctly on every task it
  answered.
- Across both runs, **46 of 46 answered cells were correct**, and **not one of
  the twelve pre-registered attractors was taken by any tier** — including
  `claude-haiku-4-5` on `d2` and `d3`.

The §4 predicted spread (fable 6, opus 6, sonnet 3, haiku 0) was wrong, and
wrong in the direction that matters: the prediction of a 0/6 Haiku was the
premise the card was built on, and Haiku answered everything correctly.

**Routing consequence: none.** `routing-table.json` keeps `route: "opus"`,
`confidence: "low"`, `rounds: 0`, `autoApply: false`. A void-equivalent round is
not evidence and does not count toward the A2 floor. The deep-reasoning class is
still unmeasured — the difference is that it is now unmeasured for a *known*
reason: on well-posed, ground-truth-checkable reasoning problems this lineup has
no ceiling left to find, Haiku included.

That result creates the bind R5 has to solve, and it is recorded in the receipt's
`review.whatWouldActuallySeparate`: the tasks that plausibly still separate the
frontier are the ones with no mechanical ground truth, and §6 could not use a
judge because all four tiers were contestants. Building a harder *mechanical*
card is likely to saturate again. R5 should wait on the cross-family judge
(`ROUTING-DOCTRINE.md` roadmap item 2), and in the meantime the cheaper probe is
to hold this card fixed and sweep effort **downward** — if every tier still
passes at `effort: low`, the live routing question is which effort, not which
tier.

**Do not tune these fixtures to manufacture separation.** The card saturating is
the result. Editing tasks until a tier fails and calling that a finding is the
exact failure mode this repo exists to avoid.
